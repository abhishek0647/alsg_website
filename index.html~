				<p><blockquote>	Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
					And sorry I could not travel both<br />
					And be one traveller, long I stood<br />
					And looked down one as far as I could<br />
					To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br /><br />

					Then took the other, as just as fair,<br />
					And having perhaps the better claim<br />
					Because it was grassy and wanted wear,<br />
					Though as for that the passing there<br />
					Had worn them really about the same,<br /><br />

					And both that morning equally lay<br />
					In leaves no step had trodden black.<br />
					Oh, I marked the first for another day!<br />
					Yet knowing how way leads on to way<br />
					I doubted if I should ever come back.<br /><br />

					I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
					Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
					Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,<br />
					I took the one less travelled by,<br />
					And that has made all the difference. <br /><br /></blockquote>
